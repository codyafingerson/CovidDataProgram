# COVID Data Processing
This GitHub repository contains a Java program designed to process real-world COVID-19 data using a minimum priority queue and a binary search tree. The program reads data from the [covid_data_world.csv](./resources/owid-covid-data.csv) file, which contains COVID-19 statistics for various countries on a daily basis from the beginning of the pandemic until September 22, 2022.

# Purpose
The main purpose of this program is to extract and analyze the top 3 records of daily new COVID-19 cases for each country and store them in a binary search tree. The program will then print these records in ascending order of new cases, along with additional information such as the continent, country, date of the largest number of cases, total COVID-19 cases on that day, current number of COVID-19 cases on that day, and the population of the country on that day.

# Data source
